1.  @keyframes firstanimation {
            from{
                
            }

            to{
                transform: translatex(1000px);
            }
    }

    -like this firstly name the animation and  then set the transition properties

2. animation: firstanimation;
    -to give animation name set in above format 

3. animation-duration: 3s; 
    -to set time duratio for animation to complete transition 

4. animation-iteration-count: 3;  
    -to set number of times to repeat animation (can be infinite) 

5. animation-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0, 0, 0, 1.27);
    -can use ease-in-out etc and then using inspect set whatever you like by just copy pasting value

6. animation-delay: 2s;
    -to set the timing to start animation in number of seconds 

7. animation-direction: reverse;
    -to set direction 
    -normal for normal animation direction 
    -reverse for starting from end (ie., animation works in reverse order)
    -alternate-reverse for one normal and one reverse animation 

8. animation-fill-mode: forwards;
    -this set the position of the element after complition of animation 
    -forwards: for leaving the element in the end position state 
    -backward: for leaving the element in initial state after omplition of animation
    -inherit: taking value of parent
    -initial: takes initial state of element 
    -unset: Acts as either `inherit` or `initial`, depending on whether the property is inherited or not.

9. animation: name duration timing-function delay iteration-count direction fill-mode;
    -to set all properties in one line
