NOTE: 1. flex direction decides the direction of main axis while column main axis is y and while row maiin axis is x and when we use justify content center it will be centered based on main axis 
        ie., for column , justify-content: center; is centering vertically.
        meanwhile for row , justify-content: center; is centering horizontally.

    2. align-items is ussed when only one row exist and align content is used when more than one row exist
