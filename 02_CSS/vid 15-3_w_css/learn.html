    <main>
        <dl>
            <div>
                <dt>1.Inline CSS</dt>
                <dd>-by this way attribute style is added to the element and commands of css are given in the same tag</dd>
                <dd>-Avoid this way mostly</dd>
            </div>
            <br>

            <div>
                <dt>2.Internal CSS</dt>
                <dd>-by this way an style tag is used in head and then commands are given in that tag by choosing selectors</dd>
                <dd>-3rd way is more preferable than this</dd>
            </div>
            <br>

            <div>
                <dt>3.External CSS</dt>
                <dd>-instead of adding css data in html the separate .css file is created and linked by using link tag to html file</dd>
                <dd>-It is the most recommanded way to add CSS</dd>
            </div>
        </dl>

            me after few days writing this msg that it actually consumed my time but actually as i am here to revise it looks so good rather than an unattractive boring txt file
