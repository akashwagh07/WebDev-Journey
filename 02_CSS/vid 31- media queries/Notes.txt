MEDIA QUERIES:
    media queries are made for responsive designs
    for eg.,

    body{
            background-color: red;
        }

        @media only screen and (max-width: 455px){
            body{
                background-color: blue;
            }
            
        }

    in above code bg color will be red but when the width of an device is less than 455 px bg color will turn into blue
