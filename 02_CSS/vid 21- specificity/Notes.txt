Cascading is the process by which conflicting CSS rules are resolved by the browser to decide which style to apply.


CSS GIVES PREFERENCES BASED ON THE CASCADE ALGORITHM:
    1. Position and order of appearance: the order in which your CSS rules appear

    2. Specificity: an algorithm that determines which CSS selector has the strongest match
    
    specificity order is as follows-->
    Inline Style > ID Selector > Class or Attribute Selector > Element Selector > Universal Selector

    3. Origin: the order in which CSS appears and where it comes from, whether that is a browser style, CSS from a browser extension, or your authored CSS 

    4. Importance: some CSS rules are weighted more heavily than others, especially with the !important rule type






SPECIFICITY CALCULATION::

    To calculate specificity, assign a value to each part of the selector:

    -Universal Selector: 0
    -Element selectors and pseudo-elements: 1
    -Class selectors, attribute selectors, and pseudo-classes: 10
    -ID selectors: 100
    -Inline styles: 1000
