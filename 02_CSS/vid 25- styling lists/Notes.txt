About list items:

    1. list item is basically consist of an marker and list element , the dot appearing before the list item is called as marker.

    2. marker can be styled by using property list-style: which has multiple choices of style like devanagari which adds marathi numering to the list elements also NONE value for property list-style will remove marker from list element

    3. whatever css we apply like bg color and border will be applied only to the list element and to avoid this and include marker too following property is used:
    list-style-position: inside;

    4.list-style-type: "ðŸ¥¸";
    [to type emoji use WINDOWS + . (full stop) and choose emoji of your choice]
    this will add emoji or any other type of mark as marker 

    5.list-style-image: url("https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/pyruslords/images/7/77/Pikachu.png");
    this will replace marker by image 

    6. list-style: inside url("https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/pyruslords/images/7/77/Pikachu.png");
    this is how mutiple list-style properties can be used in single line 

    7.by adding css liststyle none to li ,display flex to ul and padding 23px to li nav bar is ready 


OTHER PROPERTIES:

    1. display: flex;
