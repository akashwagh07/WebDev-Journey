Eery element in html is an box

so in this video i have learned about inspect button which shows the css properties padding ,margin and border and main element etc.

CSS LEARNED:
Also there are some css commands for editing every part of that element box
    eg.,
    .box1{
            color: yellow;
            padding: 10px;
            margin: 5px;
            border: 2px solid #0000ff;
            height: 200px;
            box-sizing: border-box;
            
        }

above is the example of class box1 in div tag so here is the explaination:

a.box border says that the 200px height is including the border and padding 
b.






About INSPECT:
1.whatever changes we make in code through the webpage in inspect are temporary and last's till you reload the page
  it is done through the styles tab 
2.you can see the margin,padding , content and border pictorial view in it 







MARGIN COLLAPSE:

eg.,
  .box1{
            color: yellow;
            padding: 10px;
            margin: 35px;
            border: 2px solid #0000ff;
            height: 200px;
            box-sizing: border-box;
            
        }
        .box2{
            color: red ;
            padding: 10px;
            margin: 25px;
            border: 2px solid black;
            height: 200px;
            box-sizing: border-box;
        }

in the above example the combined margins ie. diff between two borders of boxes should be 35+25=60 
but it is 35 it merges the two margins and only greater margin is diff between those two boxes 
this is called MARGIN COLLAPSE
