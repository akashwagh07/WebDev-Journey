HOW TO CONTROL OVERFLOW:
    
    1. overflow: scroll;
    this will add scroll bars on both sides and prevent content from overflowing

    2. overflow: auto;
    this will add scroll bar as per requirement based on content size 

    3. white-space: nowrap;
    this will fit content in a single horizontal line and only horizontal scroll bar will be working/appear 

    4. text-overflow: ellipsis;
    it will add 3 dots at the end of line where text is overflowing to indicate overflowing text

    5.overflow: hidden; 
    will hide the overflowing content

    6.overflow: clip;
    this will work as overflow hidden but will disable the scroll bar too , scrollbar will not appear if clip value is used 
    -When you want to ensure overflowed content is neither visible nor scrollable, and completely cut off.

    7. 
    overflow-x: hidden;

    by above properties individual side overflow can be handeled 

    8. overflow: hidden auto;
    here hidden is for x and auto is for y , 7th expression can be given as this too
