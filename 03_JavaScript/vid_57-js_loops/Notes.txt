1. general for loop:
    for (let i  = 0; i < 100; i++) {
        console.log(a+i)
        }
    -untill condition is true loop will be executed

2. for in loop -

    for (const key in obj) {
        const element = obj[key];
        console.log(key,element)
    }

    -prints the key and element inside the object obj 

3. while loop-

    let i=5;
    while(i<6){
        console.log(i);
        i+=1;
    }

    -this is example of while loop

4. do while loop (mostly avoided)

    let i=10;
    do{
        console.log(i)
        i++;
    }while(i<6);

    -here the code will execute at least one irrespective of the condition 
    -bcz do while loop firstly executes the code at least one and then checks the condition
    -this is benefitial in some cases so in those do while loop is used
