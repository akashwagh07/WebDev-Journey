in this tutorial I have learnt about the roll of classes and id in html 

Id --> th id is an unique identity for the div element and it is used only once but an id can be under multiple classes 
        called as #idname {} in css


Classes --> there can be more than one id's in one class and it is used to edit or design the specific div only by giving them the same class
    classes are called by .class_name {} in css to add changes in its designs and is applied to all elements under that class
